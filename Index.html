      <p>Welcome to Paris, where every street is a runway, every meal is a work of art, and each day holds a new adventure. Whether you're here for a weekend or planning to stay longer, here's my go-to guide to experiencing the city like a true Parisienne!

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="Images/About.jpg" alt="">

    <div class = "bottom">
      <p>Bonjour! I’m Emily, a Chicago girl who packed her bags and moved to Paris to follow my dreams (and my career!). By day, I’m a marketing executive bringing my American perspective to the chic world of Parisian luxury brands. By night (and weekends!), I’m a full-time adventurer, discovering everything the City of Lights has to offer—from hidden cafes in Le Marais to glamorous soirées in the 8th arrondissement.
      </p>
      <p>I believe that life is meant to be lived boldly, whether that means taking a risk on a new career, embracing a foreign culture, or wearing a really fabulous pair of shoes. My blog is a space where I share my love for fashion, food, and the art of finding beauty in unexpected places. From style tips to travel guides, I hope to inspire you to live your most colorful and confident life, wherever you are.
      </p>
      <p>Follow along for a behind-the-scenes look at my Parisian life, the highs, the challenges, and everything in between—always with a smile, a little bit of flair, and a croissant in hand!
        XOXO, Emily

        <h3> Pont Alexandre III</h3>

        <h3>Le Marais</h3>
        <p>
          A fashionista's paradise! Boutique shopping, vintage stores, and trendy cafes. My go-to shops are Sézane for Parisian-chic clothing and Merci for cool, quirky finds. </p>

        <h3>Claus Paris La Table du Petit Déjeuner (1st Arrondissement)</h3>
        <p>
          If you're looking for luxury, head here. From Dior to Chanel, this street is the epitome of Parisian elegance. Even if you’re just window shopping, it’s a feast for the eyes.

        <h3> Galeries Lafayette Haussmann</h3>
        <p>
          This historic department store is a true Parisian shopping mecca, featuring everything from high-end luxury brands to more affordable French labels. But the real showstopper is the stunning art nouveau glass dome and the rooftop terrace with panoramic views of Paris. Emily would spend hours here, browsing the latest fashion collections and taking in the breathtaking sights. You must visit The beauty section for French skincare and perfume, the designer floor for the latest trends, and the rooftop bar for a relaxing drink after a shopping spree.

        <h3>Avenue Montaigne</h3>
        <p>
          The go-to place for a refined and delicious brunch or 
          lunch. The ambiance is warm and sophisticated, perfect for a mid-day 
          break after exploring the nearby Louvre or Palais Royal. You must try the avocado toast with poached eggs, paired with one of their fresh-squeezed juices or a classic French quiche lorraine. Don't miss their freshly baked pastries 
          if you're in the mood for something sweet!
